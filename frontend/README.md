## Responsive updates ✅

Short note: I applied mobile-first responsive improvements that preserve the existing desktop UI but improve layouts on small screens. Changes include stacked form fields on mobile, responsive grid breakpoints, full-width action buttons on small screens, and table wrappers for horizontal scrolling.

Files updated (frontend): `src/pages/auth/SignupPage.tsx`, `src/pages/student/ProfilePage.tsx`, `src/pages/student/FeedbackPage.tsx`, `src/pages/admin/FeedbacksPage.tsx`, `src/pages/admin/StudentsPage.tsx`.
